## Features
- Historical data collection from social media platforms.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Training machine learning models for follower prediction.
- Evaluation of model performance.
- Deployment of the prediction model for real-time predictions.

## Dependencies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Time series Forecasting
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and visualization)
